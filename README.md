# WELL!

I love Modest Mouse, and I felt that Issac Brock needed a place to express himself in r/ModestMouse

Leave Issac Brock in a comment anywhere in the sub and he'll tell you his take on it.

Send me a message u/cem4k to add your favorite Modest Mouse quotes, or add them yourself and submit a PR.
